## About
Astral is an open-source IDE for <b>game</b> development using Python.<br/> 
The goal is to have a program to design your own games using easy-to-learn and different easy tools for beginners and professionals.<br/>
You are free to distribute the games you create with <b>Astral</b> in any way you like. You can even sell them.<br/>
This of course assumes that the sprites, images, and sounds you use can be distributed or sold as well.
